## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.


## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
	{
		"bearerAuth": []
	}
]
```

## API endpoints

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

All our available endpoints are documented in the [API reference page](/api-reference/checks/get-check-session-results). You can find the OpenAPI specification file [here](
