To install the script you need a project so make sure you have created one. 
If you haven't, you can create one [here](https://visitorquery.com/dashboard/projects).

Once you have your project, click on the `Settings icon -> Setup instructions` and add the domain name where you wish to install the script.

Copy the `Public API key` form that window and paste it in the script below.

```html
<script>
  (function() {
    var visitorQuery = document.createElement('script');
    visitorQuery.type = 'text/javascript';
    visitorQuery.async = true;
    visitorQuery.src = 'https://cdn.visitorquery.com/visitorquery.js';
    visitorQuery.setAttribute('data-api-key', 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY');
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(visitorQuery, s);
  })();

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title="Plant Store Endpoints"
  icon="leaf"
  href="https://github.com/mintlify/starter/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json"
>
  View the OpenAPI specification file
</Card>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
