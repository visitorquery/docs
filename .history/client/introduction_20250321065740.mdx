To install the script you need a project so make sure you have created one. 
If you haven't, you can create one [here](https://visitorquery.com/dashboard/projects).

Once you have your project, click on the `Settings icon -> Setup instructions` and add the domain name where you wish to install the script.

Copy the `Public API key` form that window and paste it in the script below by replacing `<project-public-api-key>` with it.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.visitorquery.com/visitorquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	window.addEventListener('load', () => {
		window.VisitorQuery.run({
			ApiKey   : "<project-public-api-key>",
			SessionId: "session-id-of-the-user"
		});
	});
</script>
```
