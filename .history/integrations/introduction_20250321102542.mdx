description: Example integrations with VisitorQuery
---

Our APIs and checks are easy to integrate with any platform, especially front facing apps that can inject a small piece of code in order to load our check scripts.

We are actively working on adding more integrations to our services. If you have a specific use case that you would like to see supported, please [let us know](https://visitorquery.com/support).

## Web

For web installs you need to add our official script to the page and run it. Here is an example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.visitorquery.com/visitorquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	window.addEventListener('load', () => {
		window.VisitorQuery.run({
			ApiKey   : "<project-public-api-key>",
			SessionId: "session-id-of-the-user"
		});
	});
</script>
```

That's pretty much it, place this code on any page or on the pages where you want to perform the checks. Ideally, before you need to check the results.

## React

To use our services with React, you can use our React hook which is available at [@visitorquery/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@visitorquery/react).

`npm install @visitorquery/react`

Once the package installed, add the provider in your layout or page component:

```tsx
import {VisitorQueryProvider} from "@visitorquery/react";
 
...
 
export default function Page() {
	const visitorParams = {
		apiKey   : process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VISITOR_QUERY_API_KEY,
		sessionId: getSetVisitorId(),
		endpoint : process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VISITOR_QUERY_ENDPOINT || undefined,
	};
 
	return (
		<VisitorQueryProvider {...visitorParams}>
				{children}
		</VisitorQueryProvider>
	);
}
```

Simply by adding the provider, visitorquery will perform a check on each page load.

If you need details regarding the state of the check (started, ended, loading), in order to show/hide certain ui elements, use the provided hook:


import {useVisitorQuery} from "@visitorquery/react";
 
...
 
console.log(useVisitorQuery())
The main script will be loaded automatically inti the page and the hook will take care of the rest. For a complete example and more information please refer to the hookâ€™s npm page.
