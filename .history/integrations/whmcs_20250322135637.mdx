If you are a WHMCS user, you can easily integrate VisitorQuery into your installation. 

**VisitorQuery** stops fraud and slashes chargebacks by detecting proxy and VPN users in real time. 
Unlike traditional solutions, we don't use IP checks or blacklists. 
Our AI and deep packet inspection technology catches all proxy types, **including residential ones**.

Since 99% of fraudsters use proxies or IP masking tools, our service is a must-have for any online business, especially for those in the hosting industry.

## How does it work?

Once installed, out plugin will place a small script on your WHMCS pages. When the client loads the page, the script will send a request to our servers with the client's session ID.
That request is analysed and, if a proxy or VPN is detected, the client will be unable to use certain payment gateways that you have configured.

### Why not just ban the user?

Due to false positives, banning the user is never a good idea. Even if behind a proxy or VPN, a user might be legitimate. Instead of banning we decided to allow our users to enable or disable certain payment gateways.
