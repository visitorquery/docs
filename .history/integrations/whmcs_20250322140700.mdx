If you are a WHMCS user, you can easily integrate VisitorQuery into your installation. 

**VisitorQuery** stops fraud and slashes chargebacks by detecting proxy and VPN users in real time. 
Unlike traditional solutions, we don't use IP checks or blacklists. 
Our AI and deep packet inspection technology catches all proxy types, **including residential ones**.

Since 99% of fraudsters use proxies or IP masking tools, our service is a must-have for any online business, especially for those in the hosting industry.

## How does it work?

Once installed, out plugin will place a small script on your WHMCS pages. When the client loads the page, the script will send a request to our servers with the client's session ID.
That request is analysed and, if a proxy or VPN is detected, the client will be unable to use certain payment gateways that you have configured.

### Why not just ban the user?

Due to false positives, banning the user is never a good idea. We strive for a low false positive rate, but it's never 0.
Even if behind a proxy or VPN, a user might be legitimate. Instead of banning outright we decided to allow our users to enable or disable certain payment gateways.
We have clients that allow users to pay with crypto or other methods that are not that sensible to chargebacks.

These are the settings we currently support for your plugin:

- **Project Public API KEY**: This is the public API key that you can find in your project settings.
- **Project Private API KEY**: This is the private API key that you can find in your project settings.
- **Developer API KEY**: This is the API key that you can find in your profile settings.
- **Minimum Confidence**: This is the minimum confidence level that triggers a block. If the check marks a session as a proxy with a confidence level below this, the user will be allowed to proceed unrestricted.
