If you are a WHMCS user, you can easily integrate VisitorQuery into your installation. 

**VisitorQuery** stops fraud and slashes chargebacks by detecting proxy and VPN users in real time. 
Unlike traditional solutions, we don't use IP checks or blacklists. 
Our AI and deep packet inspection technology catches all proxy types, **including residential ones**.

Since 99% of fraudsters use proxies or IP masking tools, our service is a must-have for any online business, especially for those in the hosting industry.

## How does it work?

Once installed, out plugin will place a small script on your WHMCS pages. When the client loads the page, the script will send a request to our servers with the client's session ID.
That request is analysed and, if a proxy or VPN is detected, the client will be unable to use certain payment gateways that you have configured.

### Why not just ban the user?

Due to false positives, banning the user is never a good idea. We strive for a low false positive rate, but it's never 0.
Even if behind a proxy or VPN, a user might be legitimate. Instead of banning outright we decided to allow our users to enable or disable certain payment gateways.
We have clients that allow users to pay with crypto or other methods that are not that sensible to chargebacks.

## Available settings

These are the settings we currently support for your plugin:

- **Project Public API KEY**: This is the public API key that you can find in your project settings.
- **Project Private API KEY**: This is the private API key that you can find in your project settings.
- **Developer API KEY**: This is the API key that you can find in your profile settings.
- **Minimum Confidence**: This is the minimum confidence level that triggers a block. If the check marks a session as a proxy with a confidence level below this, the user will be allowed to proceed unrestricted.
- **Show Warning Message**: If enabled, a warning message will be shown to the user if they are detected as a proxy user.
- **Warning Message**: The message that will be shown to the user if they are detected as a proxy user. If not provided, a default message will be shown.
- **Skip on Returning Clients**: If enabled, the check will be skipped for returning clients. This is useful if you want to check only on new clients.
- **Payment gateways**: A list of payment gateways that will be disabled if the user is detected as a proxy user.

### What do I do if I want to allow a user to proceed?

If you want to allow a user to continue, you can go to the detections page and Invalidate the detection.

When invalidating ALWAYS pick the right reason for invalidation. This helps us improve our detection algorithms and it may have an impact on future detections for your project.
