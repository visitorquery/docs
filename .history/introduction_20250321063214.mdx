<Info>VisitorQuery checking works in 2 stages:</Info>

1. **Client side**: You copy the javascript code that we provide and place it on the page where you want to check/verify the user.
2. **Backend side**: To see the result, you will need to issue a GET request to our backend API. This request should be done from your backend and using the user API key (you will find that in your dashboard -> api key).
