<Info>VisitorQuery checking works in 2 stages:</Info>

1. **Client side**: You copy the javascript code that we provide and place it on the page where you want to check/verify the user.
2. **Backend side**: You query our backend API for the session of the user and see their status (proxy/VPN, bot etc).
